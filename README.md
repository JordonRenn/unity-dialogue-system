# Unity Dialogue System

A Node-Based Dialogue System made for Unity using the Experimental GraphView API. Forked from Wafflus, i will be rewriting this system for my new game and making it work 100% with Unity 6 and also be making some changes to the architecture. 

## Some Changes 

- Some minor syntax, formating and variable names
- Doesn't use enumeration to string method to sleect node type
- Doesn't implement same name error detection
- assigns a unique id to every node that is created
